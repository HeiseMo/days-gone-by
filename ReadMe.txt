Name: 
Days Gone By

Idea for the game in its shortest form: 

-Clicker game with RPG elements where you must complete certain actions to survive until help comes along

Story:

-You are in a plane crash and the sole survivor of the incident, when you get to yourself you notice
you arent in the plane anymore, all you see is a forest.

The premise of the game:

-To click action buttons to collect resources to survive the crash(like collecting wood for a fire, food for hunger)

Iteration 1:

- Start screen with the story, explanations for the game and the goal. 
- Create status for: 
	-health: health of the player out of 100, if it hits 0 game over, dependant on bodyTemperature and hunger status starving
	-hunger: maintained by eating food, low hunger = changes to starving status and actions will be slower, will be out of 100
	-bodyTemperature; maintained by feeding the fire with wood,
	-wood: can be harvested from the forest, will cost energy,
	-food: can be harvested by hunting, will cost energy,
	-daysPassed: total days passed, 
- Create a days counter for days passing.
- Create status bar for; health,hunger,bodyTemperature
- Create a wood collecting system
- Create a lightFire system
- Create a function that will update the text-reader(story board) with actions taken

Iteration 2

- Create environment(rooms), one camp site(room) and one river(room), depending on the room different actions can be taken depending on player status.
- The rooms will be objects with pre defined resources in them.
- Create object for weapons and traps.
	-Weapons: Knife, Bow, Arrows
	-Traps: Basic Quality Trap, Medium Quality Trap, High Quality Trap 
- Create a food collection system connected to the weapons and trap available.
- Improve health status by including hunger.
- Survive 365 days
